## **Project Proposal**
<br>
 Create a platformer time-based,  stealth like game - where the player must take control of a runaway space ship by fixing problems on each level (problems are fixed  by the player answering multiple choice questions around AI , Cloud etc correctly). Each level will have a different theme - AI, Cloud, Engineering, Automation,  Design Thinking  etc. The Q&A's will be based on the content in the IBM Academic Initiative and Skills Build. For each question the player gets wrong, a defined > amount of time is removed  making the game play more challenging. For every question right  - time is added. If the player does not reach the Bridge of the ship in  the allotted time  - then they lose the game.

## **Learning experiences are to be taken from:**

- <a href="https://skillsbuild.org/" target="_blank">Skills Build</a>
- <a href="https://www.ibm.com/academic/home" target="_blank">IBM Academic Initiative</a>

## **Dev Setup Instructions:**

1.)  Download <a href="https://unity.com/download" target="_blank">**Unity Hub** </a>  
2.)  Through Unity Hub, download the <a href="https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive" target="_blank"> **2021.3.11f1** </a> version of the Unity editor  
3.)  Clone our repository into your desired directory

6.)  **Visual Studio** is suggested as our **preferred IDE**

## **Disclaimer for Windows**
> There are some issues with the Unity editor we used wherein the project might state that it has "compilation errors". This is generally due to the location of your Unity installation being in a directory with space characters in its name. The issue should be resolved if you move the Unity directory to another location.

## **User Stories:**
1.)  As **developers**, we want to create a more engaging way to teach Computer Science so that anyone who plays the game is inclined to continue playing it, thus gaining a stronger knowledge of Computer Science related topics as well as revise on any of our lacking subjects.  
2.)  As a **partner** of IBM, we want to create a game that will draw more attention to the valuable resources on IBM's pre-existing platform Skills Build.  
3.)  As **aspiring Computer Scientists**, we want to play a game that will both be creatively challenging and inspiring on our road to learning CS.  
4.)  As an **individual not directly involved with CS**, I'd like to play a game that could perhaps help me find a new area of interest in the CS field.  

## **Stakeholders:**
- Anyone looking to learn some CS!
- The International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)
- Assets and sprites design team
- Basically, everyone...
